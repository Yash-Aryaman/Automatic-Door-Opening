# Automatic-Door-Opening
An ultrasonic sensor is used to open to detect presence of a person who is approaching the door. When the person is in the range of the ultrasonic sensor, the door automatically opens using servo motors and a green light is flashed to indicate opening of the door in dark areas. The gate starts to close after some time and again a red light is flashed.
